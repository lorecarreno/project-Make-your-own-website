            <h1>Hello! I'm Lorena</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I live in Montevideo and I am a Graphic Designer</p>

            <h2>
                Switching my career path</h2>
            <br>
            <p>For a large part of my working life I have been a customer service assistant because I enjoy solving
                problems and being a team player. I also work as a freelance doing some graphic design (because I love
                creating things). </p>

            <p>In my free time I like to practice my chess skills, have some home decoration and play with my 3 adorable
                cats.
                My dream is to learn how to make web applications and create projects that have a positive impact on
                people's lives.</p>

            <h3> We live interesting times</h3>
            <p>
                Without any doubt we live in a world that is changing at a dizzying level, new things are discovered
                every day and
                technology is advancing without stopping.
                It is imperative to accompany this growth and keep up-to-date by learning and training to be prepared
                for the future.</p>
